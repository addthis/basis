/**
 * A CharSequence backed by a ByteBuf instead of a String. This
 * version only supports ASCII characters and so while it supports
 * mutation operations, it is best used for immutable Strings that
 * have a known, fixed Charset satisfied by the range of ASCII
 * characters. (Note: it is called Ascii to make it easier to quickly
 * understand, but technically it allows all single-byte UTF-8 chars;
 * including the NULL value 0).
 *
 * This should be particularly helpful for Strings that are
 * quickly or frequently serialized or deserialized and may not
 * even be looked.
 *
 * It uses a backing ByteBuf, so it extends DefaultByteBufHolder,
 * and should be released when no longer being used to ensure the
 * proper release of resources.
 *
 * 7/8 bit efficient note: Since in this case we are restricting the domain
 * of characters to single-bytes, we could theoretically represent them using
 * 1/8th less space. However, for a large number of reasons this would be
 * inconvenient and have other unknown performance properties. Therefore it
 * is left as a future excercise to verify and support that use case.
 *
 * malformed character handling: It might be reasonable to have an option or
 * an implementation, etc, that handles non-ascii characters in a non-
 * exceptional way. The JDK NIO Character encoding jazz has a bit of support
 * for this already. Two most likely use cases: a) transforming accented latin
 * characters into their plain ascii counterparts and b) replacing with '?' or
 * ' ' and the like.
